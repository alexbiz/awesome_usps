h1. Awesome! USPS <br/> &#x2192; 'awesome_usps'


h2. What

This library is meant to interface with the web services of USPS. It grew out of early dabbling of the USPS_Tracker plugin. The goal is to abstract the features that are most frequently used into a pleasant and consistent Ruby API. Awesome USPS started as an extension of Active Shipping but at the moment I am still struggling with how best to accomplish integration. While working on the problem I decided to release my current work as a gem for all to enjoy.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install awesome_usps</pre>

h2. The basics

In your environment.rb put.

<code>require 'awesome_usps'</code>

Create an instance of the USPS class in your application.rb

<code>USPS.new("your user name")</code>

From there use how you like in your  controllers. 

h2. Prerequisites

"Hrpicot":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ for parsing the XML. To install run sudo gem install Hpricot

"Mocha":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/ for the tests

h2. Notice about using the USPS APIs

USPS can be a bit frustrating when starting working with them. First you must apply for a USPS web tools account
This will net you a USPS user name assigned by them and a password. The password is for older versions of their api so you do not need to concern yourself with it. 
Secondly you only have accesses to the Testing Server. You should run one of the canned response to make sure everything is setup up correctly. 

usps.canned_tracking

You should receive an array as a response. 
From there you need to email USPS for your account to be changed over to production so you can send live data. This does not hold true for all their Api some of which require and additional level of clearance. See Below

h2. Notice on USPS Label APIs

USPS is kinda... bad with how they handle their various label creation APIs. Except for their Priority Mail(R) Open and Distribute API you must make an additional email or call to their customer care center to have your permission turned on to send live data to the server. It is even more complicated if you wish to create your own labels with your company logo from their response xml. See their API documentation located at
[http://www.http://www.usps.com/webtools/htm/Delivery-Confirmation.htm]:http://www.usps.com/webtools/htm/Delivery-Confirmation.htm for details on the procedure.

h2. Notice on Address Information APIs

These APIs; Specifically Address Verify, Zip Lookup, and City State Lookup also need separate permission for use of live data. 

h2. Canned Tests

Because most of the API's require an additional level of permission to use with live data every method has a canned test. They are both useful for integrating the returned data with your system and for testing that the library has not been compromised. A canned method follow this format. canned_method_name_test.

h1(smallish). Sample Usage

In your environment.rb or production.rb

<pre>require 'active_shipping'</pre>

 Then to access the plugin you much create an instance of USPS class

<pre> usps = USPS.new('Your user name')</pre>

Package up a poster and a Wii for your nephew.<br/>
<small>Note the Package Module has been taken directly from Active Shipping. Thank you James MacAulay for developing such great code. </small>

<pre>packages = [
  Package.new(  100,                        # 100 grams
                [93,10],                    # 93 cm long, 10 cm diameter
                :cylinder => true),         # cylinders have different volume calculations
  Package.new(  (7.5 * 16),                 # 7.5 lbs, times 16 oz/lb.
                [15, 10, 4.5],              # 15x10x4.5 inches
                :units => :imperial)        # not grams, not centimetres
]</pre>

Create a location to use with the Api

<pre>sender =Location.new(:name => "Matthew Bergman ",:first_name => "Matthew", :last_name => "Bergman",
:address1 => Apt 4m, :address2 => "1001 Pine Street", 
:city => "New York", :state => "NY", :zip5 => "100010", :phone => "5555555555")</pre>

International Item Class<br/>
<small>Only should be used in conjunction with the Internal Label Api </small>
<pre>
Items = [
    InternationalItem.new( 
    :description => Pens", 
    :quantity => "50" 
    :value => 200.40,                       #Will be converted back to a float if entered as a string. 
    :ounces => "50",                            
    :tariff_number => "Only use if known"   #Optional input for the api. 
    :country => "United States")
    InternationalItem.new( 
    :description => "Against The Day, Pynchon",
    :quantity => "10"
    :value => 100.25
    :ounces => "250"
    :country => "United States")
]
</pre>

h3. Note for working with Location Class

The api is very quirky about how it handles addresses. :address1 is for inputing Apt or Suite numbers and nothing else. 
Besides the obvious info, it can contain, :facility_type and :from_urbanization, which are used for specific APIs.

h2. To track a package

<pre>USPS.track("Tracking Number")
#This will return an array of tracking events example shown below

[{:eventzipcode=>"33436", :event=>"Arrival at Unit", :eventtime=>"7:23 am", :eventdate=>"June 14, 2008",
 :eventcity=>"BOYNTON BEACH", :eventstate=>"FL"},
 {:eventzipcode=>"32862", :event=>"Processed", :eventtime=>"9:50 pm", 
 :eventdate=>"June 13, 2008", :eventcity=>"ORLANDO",    :eventstate=>"FL"},
 {:eventzipcode=>"07032", :event=>"Processed", :eventtime=>"1:19 am",
 :eventdate=>"June 13, 2008", :eventcity=>"KEARNY",     :eventstate=>"NJ"},
 {:eventzipcode=>"07024", :event=>"Acceptance", :eventtime=>"3:03 pm", :eventdate=>"June 12, 
 2008", :eventcity=>"FORT LEE", :eventstate=>"NJ"}]

#Loop through and display as you wish
</pre>

h2. To get rates for a single or group of packages.

<pre>#There are two APIs. One for domestic, the other for international packages.
	 
USPS.domestic_rates(ZIP, Packages, options={})
USPS.world_rates(Country, Packages, options={})

#Both will return and array containg a hash of rates for each package.
#To access a rate hash for use you can do 

array = USPS.world_rates(Country, Packages, options={})
array[0][Priority Mail International

#You can also loop through and sort
</pre>

h2. Address Verification

<pre>#All methods here will take a location array of up to five address
	
#To verify an address and fill in missing information. 
#If mulitple addresses were found for an address :verified => false

usps.veryify_address("locations array")

#Will fill in missing zip5 and zip4 for an address
usps.zipcode_lookup("location array")

#Will fill in missing City and State for an address
usps.city_state_lookup
</pre>

h2. Service Standards

<pre>usps.priority_mail_estimated_time(origin, destination)
	
usps.standard_mail_estimated_time(origin, destination)

#Both of these methods returns a number for the amount of days a package will take to reach 
#its destination.
</pre>

h2. Express Mail Commitment

<pre>usps.express_mail_commitment(origin, destination, date=nil)
	
#returns a array of hashs containing commitment information. Example shown below
[{:state=>"MD", :cutoff=>"6:00 PM", :facility=>"EXPRESS MAIL COLLECTION BOX", :zip=>"20770", 
:street=>"119 CENTER WAY", :city=>"GREENBELT"}, {:state=>"MD", :cutoff=>"3:00 PM", 
:facility=>"EXPRESS MAIL COLLECTION BOX", :zip=>"20770", :street=>"7500 GREENWAY CENTER DRIVE", 
:city=>"GREENBELT"}]
</pre>

h1(smallish). Label APIs

All label API's generate a label image  encoded via 64bit encryption. It must be decrypted by using  
Base64.decode64(Image_file) to display correctly. The only choices for image_type right now are pdf and TIFF
An easy way to test and intergrate is to set up something along these lines in a controller.

<pre>
def deliver_confirmation
    image = USPS.new("XXXXXX").canned_delivery_confirmation_label_test
    send_data Base64.decode64(image[:label]), :type => image[:image_type], :disposition => "inline"
end
</pre>

All labels except for international labels take a straight name for their XML. 
When using International label APIs you must include both a first and last name

h2. Delivery and Signature Label Creation

<pre>usps.delivery_confirmation_label(origin, destination, service_type, image_type, label_type=1, options={})
usps.signature_confirmation_label(origin, destination, service_type, image_type, label_type=1, options={}) 

#label_type can be set to 2 if you desire to create your own labels. No label will be generated for you,
#you simply will receive a  confirmation label to use with the image you create. 

#Option hash can contain

* :weight_in_ounces 
* :seperate => puts the label directions on a seperate page. 
* :po_zip_code => Post Offic zip code
* :label_date => Can be set up to four days in the future

* :address_service => ill be notified in the future if address has been changed
* :sender_name, :sender_email, 
  :recipient_name, :recipient_email  => Used together to send an email to the recipient.

</pre>

h2. Electronic Merchandise Return Label Creation

<pre>usps.merch_return(service_type, customer, retailer, permit_number, 
                  post_office, postage_delivery_unit,  ounces, image_type, options={})
#permit_number => Input permit number provided by your local post office.
#post_office => Location class of post office that issued the permit. Address not needed
#postage_delivery_unit => Location class for delivery unit you are sending the package to.

#Option hash can contain

#Option hash can contain

 * :flat_rate => "Can be set to true if using flat rate envelopes"
 * :standardize_address => "Verify Address"
 * :waiver_signature => "No Signature Required for Delivery"
 * :no_holiday => "Do not deliver on a holiday"
 * :no_weekend
 * :seperate => puts the label directions on a seperate page
